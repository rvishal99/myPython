    "GET and POST are two of the most commonly used methods in HTTP, the protocol used to transfer data over the web. Both methods are used to submit data to a server, but they differ in how the data is sent and the purpose they serve.\n",
    "\n",
    "GET Method:\n",
    "The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server. When you enter a URL in your web browser's address bar and hit enter, the browser sends a GET request to the server, which then responds with the requested data. The data is usually in the form of a web page, an image, or some other type of resource that can be displayed by the browser. GET requests can include query parameters in the URL, which are used to specify the data to retrieve. Because GET requests are used to retrieve data, they should not have any side effects on the server, such as modifying data or performing an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "POST Method:\n",
    "The POST method is used to submit data to a server to be processed. When you submit a form on a website, for example, the data is sent to the server using a POST request. The data is sent in the body of the request, which means that it is not visible in the URL. POST requests can include a much larger amount of data than GET requests, which makes them useful for submitting forms or uploading files. Unlike GET requests, POST requests can have side effects on the server, such as modifying data or performing an action.\n",
